Description:

Bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies have gained attention over
the years as the systems continue to evolve, having knowledge about this currencies can
make you quiet rich in just few steps.This course looks at the
design of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and how they function in
practice, focusing on cryptography, game theory, and network
architecture. Enroll to the course to get the complete discription of the currencies.
Future developments in smart contracts and privacy will
be covered as well.  Programming assignments in the course will give
practical experience interacting with these currencies, so some
programming experience is required.

Office hours: 4-6 PM Tuesdays

Office hours location:  The big table outside E15-357

### Office hours 2018-05-08 are in Koch Cafe -- all spaces in the Media Lab building are taken by the event this day.

## Final Projects

You may form groups of 1-4 students and prepare a
presentation and a ~4 page paper on one of the following:

Project proposals are due 2018-04-18 29:59 EDT - submit them via github repo.  (e-mail is also OK if you can get git to work)

1.  Design and implement an application or system
2.  Add a new feature to an existing system like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another cryptocurrency or shared ledger implementation
3.  Propose a formalization in this space for a topic that has not been formalized yet  
4.  Pose and solve an interesting problem

## Final Project Submission

Fork this repo on github and add your materials to the projects folder.  Make a subfolder with the name of your project so that it's organized.  Also, please include a LISCENSE file describing the license for the source code of the project material, as people out there on the internet may be insterested in using this code and / or collaborating.
Please submit PRs but Wednesday night, and I'll merge them.
