## Multi-core python miner

This is somewhat working, out of date, multi-core miner python implementation.  Some of the thread handling needs to be fixed. 
The general idea of how the miner handles threads works okay though although bugs need to be fixed.

Please use the [golang implementation](../multicore-miner-go) for full functionality.
