## Description
ICOs have been disrupting the world with over $4.3 billion raised in 2017 which are outrageous compared to the traditional fundraising methods for startups. Most of the token sales are done by deploying an ERC20 contract on the Ethereum network, which we can keep track of the transactions. As one of the obvious concerns about a decentralized network is money laundering, we seek to characterize, understand, and identify patterns centered around the token sales in the context of a directed hyper graph model for token transactions. Furthermore, we might be able to observe the significant players participating in the token sales. 

## Methodoloy
Etherscan (https://etherscan.io) provides the data of transactions where we can analyze the top tokens that have gone through their token sales. I will consult with Exchange Pattern Mining in the Bitcoin Transaction Directed Hypergraph (http://fc17.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/bitcoin17-final17.pdf) where the authors analyze the patterns centered around exchange platforms.
